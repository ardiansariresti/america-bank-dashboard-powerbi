# Power BI Dashboard: America Bank's Deposits Report

This project is a **Power BI dashboard** analyzing bank deposits across different customer demographics.  
I created this project while learning Power BI through a **Udemy course**.  
The course provided guidance and tutorials for building the base dashboard, but I added my own **custom visuals and chart variations** to improve the design and insights.
